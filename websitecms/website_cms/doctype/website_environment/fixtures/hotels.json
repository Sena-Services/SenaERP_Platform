 "summary": "<h3>Complete Hotel Property Management</h3><p>A unified platform that connects every department of your hotel—from front desk to housekeeping to revenue management. Whether you run a boutique property or manage a multi-location chain, everything you need is in one system.</p><h4>Intelligent Reservation Management</h4><p>Manage room inventory across all channels from a single dashboard. Our channel manager syncs availability in real-time across OTAs, direct bookings, and corporate agreements. No more overbookings or manual updates across multiple systems. Visual room board shows occupancy at a glance, with drag-and-drop booking adjustments.</p><h4>Dynamic Revenue Optimization</h4><p>Set pricing rules that automatically adjust rates based on demand, seasonality, and competitor analysis. Monitor occupancy forecasts and revenue projections in real-time. A/B test different pricing strategies and measure impact immediately. Maximize revenue per available room without constant manual intervention.</p><h4>Housekeeping Orchestration</h4><p>Real-time room status updates flow between front desk and housekeeping staff. Assign cleaning tasks, track completion, prioritize VIP rooms, and flag maintenance issues—all through mobile devices. Reduce guest wait times and improve room turnover efficiency.</p><h4>Guest Experience Management</h4><p>Maintain detailed guest profiles with preferences, stay history, and special requests. Automated pre-arrival emails confirm bookings and collect preferences. In-stay messaging lets guests request services without calling the front desk. Post-stay surveys gather feedback while the experience is fresh.</p><h4>Multi-Property Management</h4><p>For hotel chains: Centralized reporting across all properties, standardized operations, and shared guest profiles. Transfer reservations between locations seamlessly. Corporate clients book across your portfolio with one account.</p><h4>Integrated Point of Sale</h4><p>Charge restaurant meals, spa services, and other amenities directly to guest rooms. Consolidated billing at checkout improves guest experience and reduces payment processing overhead.</p><h4>Analytics & Insights</h4><p>Track key metrics: occupancy rates, ADR, RevPAR, guest satisfaction scores, and operational efficiency. Identify trends, spot issues early, and make data-driven decisions about staffing, pricing, and marketing.</p><hr><p><em>Built for hoteliers who understand that exceptional operations drive exceptional guest experiences.</em></p>",
